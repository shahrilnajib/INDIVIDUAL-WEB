        <h1><b>About My Family</b></h1><br>
        <h3 class="fam1">
            I only have a small family. I have a father who is very strict but loves us very much. My father's name is Mohd Shukor bin Awang, age 45. 
            My father is a businessman. She has a hardware store near the house. Meanwhile, my mother, Fauziah binti Ismail, is 43 years old and a very loving woman. 
            Although she is just a housewife, she is very diligent and takes care of our food and drink every day. I have a brother named Muhammad Shahril Najmi bin Mohd Shukor aged 25 years. he now works with my father in our shop. 
            I have two younger sisters named Syamimi Najihah, 14 years old and Syamira Nazreen, 10 years old. although I often fight with my siblings because of small things, but I still love them.
            Even though we live a simple life but I am still grateful because my family loves me as much as I love them.
